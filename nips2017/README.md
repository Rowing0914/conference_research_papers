  1. keyword: LSTM, computational efficiency, wider and deeper, tensors, cross-layer convolution
  2. the question studied: how to widen and deepen LSTM efficiently without introducing unnecessary complexity in the nets.
  3. why it is worth studying that question: normally the width and depth of the network correlate to the complexity of the network, and that causes the inefficiency in training.
  4. the methods used: Tensorised LSTM in which the hidden states are represented by tensors and updated via a cross-layer convolution.
  5. experiments: Experiments conducted on five challenging sequence learning tasks show the potential of the proposed model
  6. the basic results: by increasing the tensor size the network can be deepened implicitly without additional parameters to tune.
